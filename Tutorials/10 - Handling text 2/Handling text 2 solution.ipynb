    "The Sheldon Cooper we all know and love (OK, some of us might not know him, and some might not love him) from the TV series \"The Big Bang Theory\" has gotten into an argument with Leonard from the same TV show. Sheldon insists that he knows the show better than anyone, and keeps making various claims about the show, which neither of them know how to prove or disprove. The two of them have reached out to you ladies and gentlemen, as data scientists, to help them. You will be given the full script of the series, with information on the episode, the scene, the person saying each dialogue line, and the dialogue lines themselves.\n",

Some lines are said by multiple people (for example, lines indicated by 'All' or 'Together'); **you must discard these lines**, for the sake of simplicity.

Your first task is to extract all lines of dialogue in each scene and episode, creating a dataframe where each row has the episode and scene where a dialogue line was said, the character who said it, and the line itself. You do not need to extract the proper name of the episode (e.g. episode 1 can appear as \"Series 01 Episode 01 - Pilot Episode\", and doesn't need to appear as \"Pilot Episode\"). Then, answer the following question: In total, how many scenes are there in each season? We're not asking about unique scenes; the same location appearing in two episodes counts as two scenes.

For the subsequent sections, you will need to have a list of recurrent characters. Assume that there are no two _named characters_ (i.e. characters who have actual names and aren't referred to generically as \"little girl\", \"grumpy grandpa\", etc.) with the same name, i.e. there are no two Sheldons, etc. Generate a list of recurrent characters who have more than 90 dialogue lines in total, and then take a look at the list you have. If you've done this correctly, you should have a list of 20 names. However, one of these is clearly not a recurrent character. Manually remove that one, and print out your list of recurrent characters. To remove that character, pay attention to the _named character_ assumption we gave you earlier on. **For all the subsequent questions, you must only keep the dialogue lines said by the recurrent characters in your list.**"

    "Sheldon claims that given a dialogue line, he can, with an accuracy of above 70%, say whether it's by himself or by someone else. Leonard contests this claim, since he believes that this claimed accuracy is too high. Leonard also suspects that it's easier for Sheldon to distinguish the lines that _aren't_ his, rather than those that _are_. We want you to put on the (proverbial) detective's hat and to investigate this claim.\n",

    "**Q6**. Divide the set of all dialogue lines into two subsets: the training set, consisting of all the seasons except the last two, and the test set, consisting of the last two seasons. Each of your data points (which is one row of your matrix) is one **dialogue line**. Now, use the scikit-learn class **TfIdfVectorizer** to create TF-IDF representations for the data points in your training and test sets. Note that since you're going to train a machine learning model, everything used in the training needs to be independent of the test set. As a preprocessing step, remove stopwords and words that appear only once from your vocabulary. Use the simple tokenizer provided in `helpers/helper_functions.py` as an input to the TfidfVectorizer class, and use the words provided in `helpers/stopwords.txt` as your stopwords."
